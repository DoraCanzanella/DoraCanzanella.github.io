<h1> //Netball// </h1><p class="sansserif">In a netball game there are seven players on court...</p>
<h3>These are the positions:</h3><ul><li>GD (Goal Defence)</li><li>GA (Goal Attack)</li><li>GK (Goal Keeper)</li><li>GS (Goal Shooter)</li><li>WD (Wind Defence)</li><li>WA (Wing Attack)</li><li>C  (Centre)</li></ul>

<p>Both teams aim to score as much as possible but every position has a restriction from an area on court. Goal Defence and Goal Attack (depending which side of the court they start at) can go to the net behind them and up to the line before the third part of the court. Goal Keeper and Goal Shooter are only allowed in the part of the court that they start in. Wind Defence and Wing Attack are the same as GD and GA except they aren't allowed in the centre circle. Centres can go anywhere on court except from centre circle. </p>
